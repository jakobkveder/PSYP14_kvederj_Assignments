#at first glance, there seem to be a few coding errors in the tibble
  #a) STAI_trait column has a min value of 3.90 (which should not be possible, as the measure scores range from 20 to 80)
  #b) age column has a max value of 444.00 (which should not be possible, as there are no documented cases of a human being living longer than 130 years)
  #c) household income has a min value of -3732.00 $
  #d) IQ column has a min value of 49.00 and a max value of 149.00, which are statistically extremely rare values (this raises some concern, as I ask myself whether a person with an IQ score of 49 would even be able to fill in the measures in an informative way)

which.max(data_HA_1$age)

#Household income will not be a predictor in any of the models of assignment 1, so I decide not to exclude the participant with the unusual value on this variable 
#I do not think it wise to speculate about the STAI_trait score of participant ID 150 and age of participant ID 93, even though the reported data might be simple entry errors (like a score of 39.00 and not 3.90 on STAI_trait, or age 44 instead of 444). I decide to exclude these two participants from the analysis for assignment 1.
#I also exclude the person with the IQ value below 50, as I deem that the measures used in this study were not adequately adapted to their present mental functioning level, causing us to lose valuable information  (diagnostically speaking, this person is characterized as having a moderate intellectual disability, and there are scales to measure constructs such as anxiety and mindfulness adapted for their population, e. g. Mindham & Espie, 2003). I decide to keep participants diagnostically categorized as having a mild intellectual disability (IQ above 60 and below 70), as a lower-than-average IQ does in itself indicate a significant limitation in intellectual functioning of the individual, but isn't enough to think of a person as disabled.

#even though sex isn't a significant predictor of pain in Model 1, I decide to leave it in, because previous research shows that sex is a predictor of pain, dependent on the type of the medical procedure participants undergo (this gives us valuable information that at the dentist's office this might not be the case: https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/insignificant-effects-in-model/)
